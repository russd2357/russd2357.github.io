Welcome to the Mestizo Waltz!

If you're wondering where the name comes from, it's co-opted from the title of the movie, "The Mephisto Waltz" -- and that's where any connection to the movie ends. Mestizo originates from Spain/Portugal refers to people of mixed racial heritage, specifically Luso-Africans (like my ancestors from Cabo Verde) or from Latin America (like my ancestors from Puerto Rico).

I have a pretty diverse set of interests, so it's a pretty approrpiate title for this blog.
